From one to thousands, Nightscout is meeting a significant need for
people with diabetes and their loved ones.

Real-time remote monitoring of CGM data has transformed lives, enabling
freedoms once thought lost to type one: Date-nights, sleep-overs,
out-of-town trips, and countless othersâ€¦ combined, they result in a
marked improvement in quality of life. The countless testimonials and
outpouring of gratitude is truly awe inspiring.

Given freely to the community, it has continued to attract individuals
willing to help and participate in its innovation and growth. People are
continually "paying it forward" and contributing their time, talents to
help improve the lives of many.  """
